## Description
Source is a (relatively) new HackCville program geared towards learning some of the fundamentals of software engineering, particularly with the backend.  Students will learn the basics behind writing server-side code, working with pre-existing REST API’s (and potentially building their own), and using “the Cloud” as both a database and a place to run their “server-side” code.  In addition, a wide variety of elective topics will be briefly touched on, including the popular front-end framework React.js, functional programming languages such as Clojure, and writing/deploying an Alexa Skill.

## Class Format
After our Kickoff on Sunday, February 4th, we’ll meet regularly on
* Wednesdays 6-7:30 PM
* Sundays 7-8:30 PM.
These class times will be devoted to some introductory learning, pair programming to reinforce concepts, time to work on personal projects, and larger community events (potentially including some speakers from Charlottesville software engineers!).

## Expectations
Participants are expected to attend both meetings each week.  If more than four absences are recorded, there is a risk of not completing the program and discontinuing membership with HackCville, so if you feel you’re at risk here, plus talk to an instructor to evaluate your situation so we can try to work something out.

## Schedule

Kick-Off (Sunday Feb 4)

Wednesday Feb 7: Git/Bash/iTerm
* It’s not the most invigorating topic in the world, but every software developer has to learn to navigate their computer using their terminal.  We’ll be discussing some basic terminal navigation commands with Bash, going over the basics of Git/GitHub (a version control system that also lets you proudly show off your codebase online), and for you Mac users the slightly sexier and more colorful terminal iTerm.

Sunday Feb 11: JavaScript
* Everyone should have finished the JavaScript Codecademy course before coming in, but let’s face it – you don’t REALLY know a language without a lot of practice.  We’ll be reviewing some of the fundamental concepts and syntax unique to JavaScript and giving some programming challenges to test your mettle.  We know some of you have more programming experience than others, so we’re hoping those with more experience can help out with those just now seeing a for-loop for the first time!

Wednesday Feb 14: More JavaScript
* Practice, practice, practice - we’ll be giving a few more challenges for you guys to play around with.

Sunday Feb 18: More JavaScript 
* One last session before we move into the meat of the course!  This is your chance to make sure you really understand all the fundamentals of JavaScript and programming before moving forward.

Wednesday Feb 21: NodeJS + Express
* Finally, the backend stuff we’ve been promising!  We’ll start talking a bit more in depth about NodeJS and running JavaScript on your machine versus the web browser.  We’ll also introduce the concept of Node packages, in particular Express which will let us work towards building a web server with Node.

Sunday Feb 25: Async + HTTP/API requests, Brainstorm first project
* Chances are, your server will need to interact with something else (like a database) outside of its own codebase.  We’ll go over how to make your code “wait” while it’s pulling from these resources and how to do so using HTTP requests, which make up the bulk of how computers talk to each other over the Internet.

Wednesday Feb 28: Firebase
* We’ve come to love JSON’s, right?  Well, we’ll be looking at an online database that’s literally structured like a giant JSON!  We’ll go over the basics of using Firebase to read/write data online and briefly touch on some of the other functionality it has (login systems have NEVER been easier).

**SPRING BREAK**

Sunday March 11: Project / Speaker(?)
* We’ve shown you some basics, now it’s your turn to try and make something!  Break into groups and spend the next chunk of time building a small scale application.  All class time through March 11 will be dedicated towards this group work.

Wednesday March 14: Project / Speaker(?)
* Continue working on whatever project ideas you came up with!  Afterwards, we’ll check in with your work, discuss where to go from there, and we’ll give resources accordingly.

Sunday March 18:  Clojure (Get lein running) USDA Food Database Query
* What is functional programming? If you said “the best thing in the world!” you are right! Today we will be setting up your environment for Clojure, a LISP built on JVM. Don’t know what those are? Don’t worry we will go over it! 

Wednesday March 21 Clojure v2 USDA Database Query
* By now, you will already be in love with clojure, so we will show how to apply it in the real world by building an app that can query the USDA database for food information. 

Sunday March 25: React
* Up until now, we’ve primarily been looking at backend code, but functioning web apps need a web page for users to interact with.  We’ll go over the basics of React, a popular JavaScript front-end framework that has access to everything Node has to offer!

Wednesday March 28: React (build small scoreboard?)
* React has a lot of tricky concepts, so we’ll spend another day talking about it.  Afterwards, you’ll have the chance to implement an (incredibly rudimentary) React App.

Sunday April 1: Graphcool
* You thought Firebase was cool? Get ready for Graphcool! Graphcool extends on the functionality provided by Firebase, allowing for more complex queries and manipulation of data. We will learn the basics of querying and mutations, all the while using React for the front end.

Wednesday April 4: AWS/Google Cloud
* Unfortunately, all the code we’ve written so far has been running locally on our machines.  Odds are, none of you want to pay for and maintain your own server, so we’ll be sneaky and deploy it to ~the Cloud~.  We’ll look at things like Amazon Lambda Functions and Google Cloud Functions so that anyone can access your server-side code, not just you.

Sunday April 8: Alexa Skills
* Speaking of Amazon Lambda, did you know that’s all you really need to write an Alexa skill?  We’ll learn to write and deploy an Alexa Skill using Node and AWS.

Wednesday April 11: Final Project
* All right, we’ve briefly touched on lots of smaller elective topics – now it’s your turn to bring in some of these technologies (or others that you’re aware of) to build something you can be proud of.  The HackCville showcase will be held Thursday, April 26, where you can show off whatever you’ll be working on over the next few weeks.

Sunday April 15: Final Project
* Time to work on the final project before the showcase.

Wednesday April 18: Final Project
* Time to work on the final project before the showcase.

Sunday April 22: Final Project
* Time to work on the final project before the showcase.

Thursday April 26: Project Showcase
* You’ve worked hard by this point, you deserve to show off a little and see what the rest of the HackCville community has accomplished.  Congrats!  You made it.  Now, go out and continue to refine your skills and eventually you can build something to make an impact.
